# Feature Specification: Application Theme Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a new spec for the theme. I am going to use Figma MCP to work on this feature. Currently this project is in MVP state, I want to now add a theme to it using an existing figma design that I have. I want to focus on modularity, understand what is navigation portion of the theme and what is the content portion. Make sure the theme ties into all existing views in this app, and that navigation is shared and not duplicated."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the application, I want to see a consistent and visually appealing theme across all pages so that I have a better and more intuitive user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on any page of the application, **When** they view the page, **Then** the page should display with the new theme, including consistent navigation and content styling.
2. **Given** a user navigates between different pages, **When** the page loads, **Then** the navigation elements remain consistent and are not reloaded or duplicated.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a page has unique content that doesn't fit the standard theme?
- How does the system handle pages that are currently unstyled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST apply a consistent theme to all existing views of the application.
- **FR-002**: The theme MUST be based on an existing Figma design. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the URL or location of the Figma design file?]
- **FR-003**: The theme implementation MUST be modular, with a clear separation between the navigation and content portions of the layout.
- **FR-004**: The navigation component MUST be shared across all views and not be duplicated in individual page templates.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST ensure that all existing functionality remains intact after the new theme is applied.
