# Quickstart for Application Theme Implementation

This document outlines the steps to verify the successful implementation of the new application theme.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Run the application**: Start the Phoenix server.

2.  **Navigate to all pages**: Visit every page in the application and verify that the new theme is applied consistently. This includes checking:
    *   **Navigation**: The main navigation bar should be present and consistent on all pages.
    *   **Content Area**: The content of each page should be styled according to the new theme.
    *   **Colors, Fonts, and Spacing**: All visual elements should match the design specifications from the Figma file.

3.  **Test responsiveness**: Resize the browser window to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and verify that the theme adapts correctly and remains usable.

4.  **Check for regressions**: Ensure that all existing functionality on each page is still working as expected. There should be no broken links, missing data, or JavaScript errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

The feature will be considered complete when:

*   All pages in the application use the new theme.
*   The theme is consistent and matches the Figma design.
*   The application is responsive across all supported screen sizes.
*   There are no functional regressions.
