# Research for Application Theme Implementation

## Research Tasks

1.  **Figma MCP Process**: Research the Figma MCP (Material Color Palette) process to understand how to best extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) and assets (icons, logos) from a Figma design file. The output of this research should be a clear set of steps for exporting theme information from Figma.

2.  **Modular Phoenix LiveView Components**: Research best practices for creating modular and reusable UI components in Phoenix LiveView. This should include looking into component composition, passing properties, and managing state for UI components.

3.  **Phoenix LiveView and Tailwind CSS Integration**: Investigate the best practices for integrating Phoenix LiveView and Tailwind CSS, particularly in the context of a modular theme. This should cover topics like Tailwind configuration, CSS organization, and how to handle dynamic classes in LiveView.

## Unresolved Questions

1.  **Figma Design File**: What is the URL or location of the Figma design file? This is critical for starting the theme implementation.

2.  **Performance Goals**: Are there any specific performance goals for page load times or resource usage? This will influence decisions around asset optimization and component loading.
