# Feature Specification: Slickage Dashboard MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-dashboard-init`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Look at ./docs/specify.md for details"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user (Anthony, Julie, Ryan, Chris, James, or a Client), I want a unified dashboard to get a complete overview of my projects, including tasks, communication, documents, and deployments, so that I can efficiently track project status and access relevant information from a single place.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Epic A: Foundation & Integrations**
1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they visit the dashboard, **Then** they should be prompted to log in with Google OAuth.
2. **Given** a user is logged in for the first time, **When** they navigate to the settings page, **Then** they should be able to connect their Linear, Slack, Notion, GitHub, and Google Drive accounts.

**Epic A1: Home Overview**
1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they visit the Home Overview, **Then** they should see a summary of their projects, clients, team workload, active incidents, and CI status.
2. **Given** a user is on the Home Overview, **When** they click a "Refresh" button, **Then** the data on the page should be updated with the latest information from the integrated services.

**Epic B: Clients & Projects**
1. **Given** a user is on the Projects page, **When** they select a project, **Then** they should see a project-specific hub with deep links to resources in Linear, Slack, Google Drive, and Notion.

**Epic C: SOW & Change Requests**
1. **Given** a user with appropriate permissions, **When** they are viewing a project, **Then** they should be able to see associated SOWs and Change Requests from Google Drive.
2. **Given** a new SOW or CR is added in Google Drive, **When** the system syncs, **Then** a notification should be sent to the relevant Slack channel.

**Epic D: Work Status**
1. **Given** a user is viewing a project, **When** they look at the work status section, **Then** they should see project-scoped tasks from Linear with deep links to the issues.
2. **Given** a user has the correct permissions, **When** they are on the project page, **Then** they should be able to create a new Linear issue using a predefined template.

**Epic E: Deployments & Health**
1. **Given** a user is viewing a project, **When** they check the deployments section, **Then** they should see the status of recent deployments and a GitHub Checks card.
2. **Given** a deployment fails, **When** the system detects the failure, **Then** an alert should be sent to the appropriate Slack channel.

**Epic F: KB & Case Studies**
1. **Given** a user is on the KB section, **When** they search for a topic, **Then** they should see an indexed list of relevant documents from Notion with deep links.

**Epic G: Minimal Analytics**
1. **Given** a user with admin rights, **When** they navigate to the analytics page, **Then** they should see metrics like uptime %, MTTR, and Linear throughput.
2. **Given** a user is viewing the analytics, **When** they click "Export", **Then** a CSV file with the analytics data should be downloaded.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an external service (Linear, Slack, etc.) is unavailable?
- How does the system handle authorization errors when a user's token for an external service expires?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to authenticate via Google OAuth.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to connect their Linear, Slack, Notion, GitHub, and Google Drive accounts.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a home overview with project, client, workload, incident, and CI information.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a manual refresh mechanism for the home overview.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a project-specific hub with links to integrated services.
- **FR-006**: System MUST display SOWs and Change Requests from Google Drive.
- **FR-007**: System MUST send notifications to Slack for new SOWs/CRs.
- **FR-008**: System MUST display project-scoped tasks from Linear.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow creation of Linear issues from a template.
- **FR-010**: System MUST display deployment status and GitHub Checks.
- **FR-011**: System MUST send Slack alerts for deployment failures.
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide an indexed and searchable KB from Notion.
- **FR-013**: System MUST display analytics (uptime, MTTR, Linear throughput).
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow exporting analytics to CSV.
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement RBAC for admin, employee, and client roles.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: The central hub, linked to clients and all integrated data.
- **Client**: Represents a customer, associated with one or more projects.
- **User**: Represents a person with access to the system, has a role (admin, employee, client).
- **Integration**: Stores credentials/tokens for connected services (Linear, Slack, etc.).
- **SOW/CR**: Metadata and link to a document in Google Drive.
- **Task**: Data from a Linear issue.
- **Deployment**: Data about a deployment event.
